# Leetcode
In this repository, I have documented my solutions to various LeetCode problems, which is a well-known platform for enhancing one's technical coding skills and preparing for technical coding interviews. This repository is a record of my ongoing progress and development as a skilled developer.

# How to navigate this repository
To navigate this repository, each problem has its own folder with the problem name. The solution file is named using the problem number and a brief description of the problem.

# Purpose
I am utilizing LeetCode to improve my problem-solving proficiency, coding skills, and to prepare for upcoming technical coding interviews. By solving these problems, I am expanding my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns. This allows me to strengthen my expertise in these areas and learn new concepts that I may not have been familiar with before. This experience helps me tackle complex coding challenges with increased confidence and efficiency. Additionally, the knowledge gained from LeetCode can be leveraged throughout my career as a software developer.

Although this repository is primarily for my personal use, I encourage other developers to contribute by improving the solutions or suggesting alternative approaches. If you come across any issues or have ideas for improving the code, please feel free to create a pull request or issue. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
